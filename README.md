## Description
This love calculator was created using three separate API's, from Spotify, Pexels and RapidAPI's "love calculator". Within this project we also used the following CDNS: Jquery (for shorter code), Materialize(for faster UX/UI) and Google fonts.

## Functionality
The love calculator works as follows. As the user opens the page, they are first introduced with a modal "on button click" which explains how the love calculator works. They are then shown the love calculator which calculates their "love percentage" on request. The user is to input two names. One for their names and a second for their "lovers" name. Once the names are inputed, they can then click the "calculate percent" button and it will automatically populate the love percentage between them and the other name. 
## 
If the the percentage populated is less than <= 40% the page will automatically be redirected to a seprate HTML with a "Love Sucks" theme. This page is meant to cheer up the user with an "I hate love songs" playlist and "uplifting" images. 
## 
If the percentage populated is over >= 40% the page will automatically be redirected to a seprate HTML with an "In love" theme. This page is meant to remind the user of why they're so in love with an "In Love" playlist and "love" images.

## !!THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETE SATIRE-
Does NOT actually calculate real love percent between you and your lover.
